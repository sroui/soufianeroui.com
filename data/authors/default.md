Hello, I'm a Moroccan software engineer who is patient about technology and amazed how many things can be achieved with the software. Mainly interested in service-oriented architecture style, writing high quality, maintainable, software.

I have a master's degree in Computer Science from National Schools of Applied Sciences. This is my personal blog where I share my thoughts and ideas.
