# Introduction

Most java libraries and frameworks define a version baseline for either Java or the APIs it uses. "The baseline" primarily means the minimum version required to run a Spring application. Correspondingly, Spring Framework 6 has baseline upgrades that are described in the following sections.

# Java baseline upgrade

The java baseline for Spring 6 is Java 17 which is an LTS that is released on September 14, 2021. I think it is a good choice to require Java 17 as a minimum because of the two years cadence that java follows for LTS versions.

# Java EE baseline upgrade

Spring 6 requires Jakarta EE 9 as a minimum which will enforce you to use a web server that supports it and you will need also to do some renaming of packages (`javax. *` -> `Jakarta. *`) if you want to upgrade from Spring prior versions.
