# Introduction

One of the most important caracterstics of a production grade application, is that is offers you possibility to observe what is going on in terms of memory/cpu usage, components health e.g. databse connection, and functionality. For that matter, Spring Boot 3 introduces [Observation API](https://micrometer.io/docs/observation) which is part of the [micrometer project](https://micrometer.io/). The API will help you generate outputs that will be used by developers or third-party software to monitor your application.

## Monitoring vs Observability

Observability is about generating outputs from our system which will help us understand the exact root cause of a problem e.g. metrics, logs, and traces. On the other hand, monitoring is about collecting and analyzing data fetched from our system.

## Observation API

### Observation lifecycle

Let us say, we want to register a user in our system, and we want to make the registration action observable. To do so we can wrap the user registration code in an [Observation](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/main/micrometer-observation/src/main/java/io/micrometer/observation/Observation.java) that will be responsible for making the user registration action observable to a developer or third-party software.

Before jumping into the API, we need to know about the lifecyle of an [Observation](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/main/micrometer-observation/src/main/java/io/micrometer/observation/Observation.java). Bellow is a diagram that simplifies the lifecyle of an Observation:

  />

</figure>

An observation can open/close a scope multiple times.
Bellow code is a demonstration of the lifecycle phases mentionned above:

```java
ObservationRegistry observationRegistry = ObservationRegistry.create();
Observation observation = Observation.createNotStarted("sample", observationRegistry); // stopped

observation.start(); //started

try (Observation.Scope scope = observation.openScope()) { // scope opened and closed after action execution
   System.out.println("Observed Action");
} catch (Exception e) {
   observation.error(e); //error
} finally {
   observation.stop(); //stopped
}
```

And bellow code is a simplified version:

```java
ObservationRegistry observationRegistry = ObservationRegistry.create();
Observation observation = Observation.createNotStarted("sample", observationRegistry);

observation.observe(() -> System.out.println("Observed Action"));
```

### Observation, ObservationRegistry, and ObservationHandler

An `ObservationRegistry` is responsible for building and storing instances of an `Observation`, whereas instances of `ObservationHandler` are responsible for handling different lifecycle phases of an `Observation`.

You can build an ObservationHandler using bellow code which will expose prometheus metrics:

```java
observationRegistry = ObservationRegistry.create();
meterRegistry = new PrometheusMeterRegistry(PrometheusConfig.DEFAULT);
observationRegistry.observationConfig().observationHandler(new DefaultMeterObservationHandler(meterRegistry));
```

then, you can use bellow code to create an observation and display created metrics:

```java
Observation observation = Observation.createNotStarted("test", observationRegistry);
observation.observe(() -> log.info("Action performed"));
log.info("Prometheus metrics:\n{}", ((PrometheusMeterRegistry) meterRegistry).scrape());
```

All above code is included in the github repository [observation-api-demo](https://github.com/sroui/tutorials/tree/main/spring/observation-api-demo).

See you in the next part!
